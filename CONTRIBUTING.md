## Our Development Process

We develop our code using the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools)
package. You can use the 'devtools::check' function to build and verify that
your changes are working as intended.

## Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")
In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need to do this once, so if you've done this for one repository in the [prestodb](https://github.com/prestodb) organization, you're good to go. If you are submitting a pull request for the first time, the communitybridge-easycla bot will notify you if you haven't signed, and will provide you with a link.  If you are contributing on behalf of a company, you might want to let the person who manages your corporate CLA whitelist know they will be receiving a request from you.

## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.
